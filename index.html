  <h1>Solving Sol</h1>
  <div class="info">
    An open project to implement Sol LeWitt's instructions in JavaScript.<br>

    Sol LeWitt was an American artist who is regarded as the founder of Conceptual and Minimal art.<br>

    A portion of his work were wall drawings for which he only provided instructions.<br>

    The instructions are simple and subtly open to interpretation. They're also good candidates to be executed
    programatically.<br>

    <strong>PS: p5.js library is used for sketches. Then I converted the sketches into gifs. I am planning to implement
      more wall drawings.</strong>
